 * Spaces allow expression and interaction via live audio conversations.
 * The Space data dictionary contains relevant metadata about a Space; all the details are updated in real time.
 * User objects can be found and expanded in the user resource.
 * These objects are available for expansion by adding at least one of host_ids, creator_id, speaker_ids, mentioned_user_ids to the expansions query parameter.
 *
 * Unlike Tweets, Spaces are ephemeral and become unavailable after they end or when they are canceled by their creator.
 * When your app handles Spaces data, you are responsible for returning the most up-to-date information, and must remove data that is no longer available from the platform.
 * The [Spaces lookup endpoints](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/spaces/lookup/introduction) can help you ensure you respect the usersâ€™ expectations and intent.*/
